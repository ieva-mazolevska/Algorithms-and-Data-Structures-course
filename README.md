This program performs several operations on a **singly linked list** of `n` integer elements:

1. **Finds the position** (0-based index) of the **smallest element** in the list.
2. **Calculates the product** of elements located **between the first and second negative elements**.
3. **Reorganizes** the list so that:
   - First come elements whose **absolute value is less than or equal to 3**
   - Then come **all other elements**

This program demonstrates traversal, conditional logic, and list reordering.

Features

- Create and populate a singly linked list
- Identify the smallest element and its index
- Detect negative values and compute the product between the first two
- Rearrange the list based on absolute value conditions
- Print the list before and after reordering
