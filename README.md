This program demonstrates the use of two types of linked lists:

1. A **singly linked list**, where integers are stored (repeated numbers are allowed).
2. A **doubly linked list**, which is created from the first list and contains **only unique (non-repeating)** numbers.

It serves as a practical example of working with linked data structures and filtering data.
