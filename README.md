# DuplicateExtractor â€“ Extracting Repeated Numbers from a Doubly Linked List

## Description

This program processes a **doubly linked list** of integers, where values **may repeat**. It scans the list and builds a **singly linked list** containing **only the values that appear more than once** in the original list.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Doubly Linked List

- Implemented dynamically
- Supports:
  - Element insertion
  - Full list traversal and printing

### 2. Singly Linked List

- Constructed dynamically
- Stores only **repeated (duplicate)** values from the original doubly linked list
- No duplicate values in the final singly list (i.e., each value added only once)

---

## Functionality

The program performs the following steps:

1. Accepts user input to fill a **doubly linked list**  
2. Counts the occurrences of each number  
3. Builds a **singly linked list** with values that appear **more than once**  
4. Prints both lists
