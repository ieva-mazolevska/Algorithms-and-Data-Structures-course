This program implements a **dynamic doubly linked list** with the following operations:

- **Insertion** of elements
- **Deletion** of elements
- **Search** for elements
- **Printing** the list

  After performing operations on the doubly linked list, the program **transfers all elements** into a **singly circular linked list** and prints its contents.

Features
- Create and manage a **doubly linked list**
- Perform **insert, delete, print, search** functions on it
- **Convert** the list to a **singly circular linked list**
- **Print** the elements of the circular list

How It Works
1. The user interacts with the doubly linked list (inserts, deletes, searches, prints).
2. When ready, the program copies all nodes into a singly circular list.
3. Finally, the circular list is printed to show successful transformation.
