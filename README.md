Practical homework assignments and tests for Algorithms and Data Structures course
This program performs multiple operations on a **one-dimensional array** of `n` elements:

1. **Counts** how many elements fall within a given interval `[a; b]`.
2. **Calculates the sum** of all elements that appear **after the maximum element** in the array.
3. **Sorts** the array in **ascending order**.

This exercise is designed to practice array traversal, conditional logic, and sorting.

Features

- Input an integer array of size `n`
- Count elements in a specified range `[a; b]`
- Find the maximum value and sum all elements that follow it
- Sort the array in increasing order and display the result
