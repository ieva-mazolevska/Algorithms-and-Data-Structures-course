Given two integers n and m (m < n). Characters s1, s2, ..., sn are stored in a list.
Creates a new list containing the characters s(m+1), s(m+2), ..., sn, sm, ..., s1.

How to Use:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter an integer n – the total number of characters.
3. Enter an integer m – a position such that m < n.
4. Enter n characters in sequence.
5. The program will output the rearranged list.

This program was developed as a learning project based on a specific assignment.
